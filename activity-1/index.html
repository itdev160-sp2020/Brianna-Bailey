    <h1>Brianna Bailey</h1><br>
    <h2>WEBDEV-114 Web Development w/HTML and CSS</h2><br>
    <p>What I plan to create for my final project in this class would be a personal website of my Original Characters
        using pictures, biography, information on the characters, their powers, my inspiration to make the characters,
        and their relations to other characters. I plan to use the knowledge from this class to create the website for
        my final project. I hope in doing so I will create an affective website.</p>
